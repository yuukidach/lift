## Features

- MacOS-style mission control that allows you to visually navigate between workspaces <details><summary><sup>click to see mission control</sup></summary><img src="assets/mission_control.png" alt="Rift Mission Control view" /></details>
- Focus follows the mouse with auto raise
- Drag windows over one another to swap positions
- Performant animations <sup>(as seen in the [demo](#rift))</sup>
- Switch to next/previous workspace with trackpad gestures <sup>(just like native macOS)</sup>
- Hot reloadable configuration
- Interop with third-party programs (ie Sketchybar)
  - Requests can be made to rift via the cli or the mach port exposed [(lua client here)](https://github.com/acsandmann/rift.lua)
  - Signals can be sent on startup, workspace switches, and when the windows within a workspace change. These signals can be sent via a command(cli) or through a mach connection
- Does **not** require disabling SIP
- Works with “Displays have separate Spaces” enabled (unlike all other major WMs)

## Status
Rift is in active development but is still generally stable. There is no official release yet; expect ongoing changes.

> Issues and PRs are very welcome.

## Community
Join the Rift community on Matrix for discussion, support, and announcements: [#rift:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#rift:matrix.org)

## Motivation
Aerospace worked well for me, but I missed animations and the ability to use fullscreen on one display while working on the other. I also prefer leveraging private/undocumented APIs as they tend to be more reliable (due to the OS being built on them and all the public APIs) and performant.

## Credits
Rift began as a fork (and is licensed as such) of <a href="https://github.com/glide-wm/glide">glide-wm</a> but has since diverged significantly. It uses private APIs reverse engineered by yabai and other projects. It is not affiliated with glide-wm or yabai.
